# MATLAB-Based Helmet Detection and Image Analytics System

This project involves the development of a system using MATLAB that detects whether individuals in an image are wearing helmets. It also performs real-time analytics on the detected images to analyze and report on the presence or absence of helmets.

## Features

- **Helmet Detection:** Utilize computer vision techniques to detect individuals wearing or not wearing helmets in images.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Simultaneously analyze detected images to provide insights and statistics on helmet usage.
- **Visualization:** Display detected images with analytical overlays for easy interpretation.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large volumes of image data efficiently.

## Components

1. **Image Acquisition:**
   - Capture images using cameras or import from existing image datasets.

2. **Helmet Detection:**
   - Implement object detection algorithms in MATLAB to identify helmets.

3. **Analytics:**
   - Analyze the detected images to generate reports on helmet usage.
   - Provide statistical data on the number of individuals with and without helmets.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Display images with detected helmets highlighted.
   - Show analytical results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matlab-helmet-detection-analytics.git
   ```

2. Set up MATLAB with the required toolboxes and dependencies.

3. Run the main script to start the detection and analytics system.

## Usage

1. **Image Acquisition:**
   - Import images or connect to a camera feed.

2. **Run Detection:**
   - Execute the helmet detection script in MATLAB.

3. **View Analytics:**
   - Analyze and visualize the results in real-time.
